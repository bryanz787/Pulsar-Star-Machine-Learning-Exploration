# Pulsar-Star-Machine-Learning-Exploration
An R based analysis and writeup on the public access HTRU2 dataset containing pulsar star radiation data.
Using R and the tidyverse library a classification model was trained to help identify pulsar star signals.

With this project we will try to determine what classifies a pulsar star versus background noise through 
the training of a knn-model classification model and identify key identifiers to predict whether a given 
data point is truly a pulsar or not using the HTRU2 dataset found here:

Report is delivered in the form of a JupyterLab notebook in an effort to better integrate Markdown-based 
textual analysis within the code and enhance readability for a seamless viewing experience.
